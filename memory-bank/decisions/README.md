# <Decision title>

## Context
What forced the decision? What constraints applied?

## Decision
What did we decide? Be specific.

## Alternatives considered
What else was on the table? Why did we not pick them?

## Consequences
What does this lock in or rule out going forward?

## Revisit when
If a condition changes that should make us re-open this decision, name it.
```

## Why ADRs

So v2/v3/v4 of this project doesn't re-litigate the same arguments. If we ever say "wait, why did we pick X?" — the answer is in this folder.
